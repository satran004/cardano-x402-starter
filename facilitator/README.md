# Cardano x402 Facilitator

An [x402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) v2 facilitator for Cardano, in Java.

x402 revives HTTP `402 Payment Required` as a real payment flow: a resource
server quotes a price, a client pays, and the server serves. The **facilitator**
is the piece that answers two questions on the server's behalf — *is this payment
valid?* and *did it actually settle?* — so the resource server needs no chain
integration of its own.

This service implements the Cardano `exact` scheme of the x402 protocol.

**The facilitator never holds keys and never signs.** It verifies transactions
the payer already signed, and submits them. It cannot move funds on its own.

## Status

Compatibility target: `@x402/cardano` and `@x402/core` **2.26.0**, upstream
[`x402-foundation/x402` main at `6323ec7`](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/tree/6323ec74c85607e706e0722dd294365a7fb57768).
The upgrade includes TypeScript-generated signed vectors, a real HTTP SDK
interoperability gate, and PostgreSQL migration/concurrency tests. See
[testing](docs/testing.md) and [upgrade notes](docs/upstream-compatibility.md).

An earlier version was proven on preprod. This upgrade's verification uses a
controlled offline chain; it has not repeated that live proof or run on mainnet.
The full self-hosted Compose stack is not exercised by these tests.

## Features

- **All three x402 Cardano transfer methods** — `default` (address-to-address),
  `masumi` (`vested_pay` escrow, rules M1–M9), and `script` (arbitrary Plutus
  locks with aiken UPLC parameter application).
- **Facilitator submission** — the payer signs, the facilitator broadcasts once,
  and retries reconcile durable evidence. Confirmation policy spans authenticated
  acceptance (`-1`, operator opt-in), canonical inclusion (`0`), and depth (`1..20`).
- **Pre-submit validation** — canonical payloads, input quantities, value
  conservation, minimum fees and signatures, with an optional full phase-1
  validator for transactions beyond ordinary transfers.
- **One Blockfrost-compatible chain client** — point it at hosted Blockfrost or
  a standalone yaci-store instance (your own cardano-node + yaci-store,
  consumed over its Blockfrost-compatible API) — chosen per network via
  `BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL`, same code path either way.
- **Settlement that survives reality** — journalled in Postgres, fenced CAS
  transitions, an asynchronous reconciler, and rollback detection. A tx that
  lands after the HTTP response, or a process that dies mid-submit, resolves
  correctly.
- **Tri-state UTxO resolution** — the chain SPI models `Unspent` / `Spent` /
  `Unknown`, so a lagging indexer can degrade to a retryable error rather than a
  guess. The current backend is Blockfrost-compatible and resolves an absent
  output straight to `Spent`, whether it's hosted Blockfrost or yaci-store.
- **A structured error-code catalog** covering every verification and
  settlement failure mode.
- Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5, virtual threads, Log4j2, Prometheus metrics.

## Quickstart

Requires Java 21 and a PostgreSQL. With Docker:

```bash
cd deploy
test -e .env || cp .env.example .env
# Set BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID in .env; optionally override the local DB password.
docker compose --profile light up -d --build
```

Compose uses the official PostgreSQL image with a single `postgres` user and
`POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (local default `postgres`). Keep `deploy/.env`
private; it is ignored by Git. An existing volume retains its stored password;
follow the [existing-volume guidance](deploy/README.md#postgresql-and-existing-volumes)
if the configured password differs.

Or run it directly:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home
BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID=preprod... ./gradlew bootRun
```

Check it's serving:

```bash
curl localhost:4022/supported
# {"kinds":[{"x402Version":2,"scheme":"exact","network":"cardano:preprod",
#            "extra":{"assetTransferMethods":["default","masumi","script"],
#                     "l1Confirmations":{"minimum":0,"maximum":20}, ...}}], ...}
```

The `extra` block is the capability contract a resource server checks its
policies against before serving a 402 — see [docs/api.md](docs/api.md#get-supported).

Then prove it works against the real chain — build, sign, verify, settle, and
independently confirm on-chain:

```bash
BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID=preprod... ./gradlew e2e
```

See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) — including how to point it at your own
wallet, which you should.

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/verify` | Is this signed payment valid? |
| `POST` | `/settle` | Submit it and confirm it |
| `GET` | `/supported` | Which (version, scheme, network) triples are served |
| `GET` | `/health` | Human-facing summary |
| `GET` | `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/prometheus` | Probes and metrics |

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:4022/verify -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "paymentPayload": {
    "x402Version": 2,
    "resource": { "url": "https://example.test/report" },
    "accepted": { "scheme": "exact", "network": "cardano:preprod",
                  "asset": "lovelace", "amount": "1500000", "payTo": "addr_test1..." },
    "payload": { "transaction": "<base64 signed tx CBOR>", "nonce": "<txHash>#0" }
  },
  "paymentRequirements": { "scheme": "exact", "network": "cardano:preprod",
                           "asset": "lovelace", "amount": "1500000", "payTo": "addr_test1...",
                           "maxTimeoutSeconds": 600,
                           "extra": { "assetTransferMethod": "default" } }
}'
```

Two things clients get wrong:

- **A rejected payment is `200 OK`** with `isValid: false`. Read the body, not
  the status.
- **`settle` failing with `settlement_pending` and a
  non-empty `transaction` does not mean the payment failed.** Broadcast may have occurred
  and it may still land. Retry the same payment to reconcile that hash.

Full contract and every error code: [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).

## Configuration

Everything lives under `x402` in `application.yml`. The minimum is one network
with a backend:

```yaml
x402:
  networks:
    - id: "cardano:preprod"
      chain:
        blockfrost:
          base-url: https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0
          project-id: ${BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID}
```

`x402.networks` is a list, so one process can serve several networks — each gets
its own chain backend, scheme, settlement service and `/supported` entry. To keep
them out of the image, point `NETWORKS_FILE` at an external file shaped like
[docs/networks_example.yml](docs/networks_example.yml):

```bash
NETWORKS_FILE=file:/etc/x402/networks.yml java -jar facilitator.jar
```

It **replaces** the list in `application.yml` rather than adding to it, and the
`file:` prefix is required — a bare path is silently ignored.

The facilitator has no built-in HTTP authentication or rate limiting. Compose
publishes its API on host loopback; protect any remote ingress separately.
CORS remains opt-in. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Development

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home

./gradlew test        # Docker needed for the Postgres IT
npm ci --prefix interop --ignore-scripts
./gradlew interop     # published TypeScript SDKs against real Java HTTP
./gradlew bootRun     # run locally
./gradlew e2e         # on-chain proof; facilitator must be running
```

Stack: Java 21 · Spring Boot 3.5.16 · cardano-client-lib 0.7.2 ·
aiken-java-binding 0.1.0 · PostgreSQL · Gradle 8.14. yaci-store runs as a
standalone service (`bloxbean/yaci-store:2.0.2` in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`),
not a facilitator dependency.

Before changing chain code, read the "Chain access layer" section of
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — the tri-state `UtxoState` SPI
contract, and how hosted Blockfrost and a standalone yaci-store both resolve to
the same `BlockfrostChainService` HTTP client, are worth understanding before
touching it.

## Security

- The facilitator holds **no keys** and signs nothing.
- `/verify` and `/settle` do not authenticate callers. Compose publishes the
  facilitator on host loopback; direct JAR launches use Spring Boot's listener
  setting. Use a protected TLS ingress if the API is remotely reachable.
- The `masumi` escrow address is **derived** from the deployment parameters and
  `payTo` must equal it, so a hostile address fails regardless of configuration.
  The script-hash allowlist narrows that further to deployments you nominate, and
  is inactive until configured — set it before mainnet.
- The E2E test requires externally supplied preprod credentials. Rotate the
  values exposed in earlier source history before using that environment again.
