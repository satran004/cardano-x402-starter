# Configuration Reference

All properties live under the `x402` prefix (`config/X402Properties`), set in
`application.yml` or overridden per environment. Standard Spring relaxed binding
applies, so `x402.settle.confirmation-depth` is
`X402_SETTLE_CONFIRMATIONDEPTH` as an environment variable.

Defaults below are the **code** defaults (the `…OrDefault()` accessors), which
apply when a key is absent entirely. `application.yml` ships explicit values for
most of them; where the shipped value differs from the code default, both are
listed.

## Chain backend

There is exactly one chain backend: the cardano-client-lib Blockfrost provider
(`BFBackendService`, wrapped in `BlockfrostChainService`). Configure it per
network with `chain.blockfrost.base-url` (env `BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL`) and
`chain.blockfrost.project-id` (env `BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID`) — that's the entire
surface, no "mode" property involved:

```bash
BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID=... java -jar facilitator.jar
BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1/blockfrost java -jar facilitator.jar
```

To run against a standalone yaci-store instead of hosted Blockfrost, point
`base-url` at its Blockfrost-compatible endpoint; `project-id` is required for
hosted Blockfrost and ignored by yaci-store. Same client, same code path
either way — see [architecture.md](architecture.md#the-chain-backend).
yaci-store's own sync/submission configuration (which node to follow, protocol
magic, N2C socket, sync-start intersect, pruning) lives on the yaci-store
service itself, not the facilitator; see
[../deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md) for the Compose wiring.

## Server and datasource

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `server.port` | `4022` | |
| `spring.datasource.url` | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres` | env `DB_URL` |
| `spring.datasource.username` | `postgres` | env `DB_USER` |
| `spring.datasource.password` | `postgres` (local development only) | env `DB_PASSWORD` |
| `spring.flyway.enabled` | `false` | Deliberate — see below |
| `spring.threads.virtual.enabled` | `true` | |

`spring.flyway.enabled: false` is not an oversight. The facilitator schema is
migrated by a **programmatic** runner (`FlywayConfig`) into the `facilitator`
schema with its own history table — the only Flyway runner in the process now
that yaci-store, when used, runs as a separate service with its own schema and
migrations.

## Networks

At least one entry is required; startup fails otherwise.

```yaml
x402:
  networks:
    - id: "cardano:preprod"       # cardano:mainnet | cardano:preprod | cardano:preview
      required: true              # default true
      chain:
        blockfrost:
          # Hosted Blockfrost, OR a standalone yaci-store's Blockfrost-compatible
          # endpoint (e.g. http://yaci-store:8080/api/v1/blockfrost). project-id is
          # required for hosted Blockfrost and ignored by yaci-store.
          base-url: ${BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL:https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0}
          project-id: ${BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID:}
      slot-config:                # optional; overrides the built-in anchor
        zero-slot: 86400
        zero-time-epoch-seconds: 1655769600
        slot-length-ms: 1000
```

Built-in anchors (`ShelleyNetworkClock`), used when `slot-config` is absent —
override only if you have a reason:

| Network | `zero-slot` | `zero-time-epoch-seconds` | `slot-length-ms` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cardano:mainnet` | `4492800` | `1596059091` | `1000` |
| `cardano:preprod` | `86400` | `1655769600` | `1000` |
| `cardano:preview` | `0` | `1666656000` | `1000` |

**An override needs both `zero-slot` and `zero-time-epoch-seconds`.** Supplying
only one silently falls back to the built-in anchor for that network rather than
failing — so a partial override looks applied and isn't. `slot-length-ms`
defaults to `1000` and may be omitted; an applied override must use a positive length.

Transaction validity uses the current wall-clock slot from this configuration,
as in the TypeScript SDK. The latest indexed block may be several slots behind;
its slot is used for chain evidence, not as the clock for a fresh transaction.
For standard preprod, no slot override is needed. `maxTimeoutSeconds` comes from
the resource server's quote; settlement waiting time does not change that limit.

| Key | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Must be a supported network; CIP-34 aliases normalize at startup; duplicate canonical networks are rejected |
| `required` | no (`true`) | |
| `chain.blockfrost.base-url` | yes | Hosted Blockfrost or a standalone yaci-store's Blockfrost-compatible endpoint (env `BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL`); startup fails without it |
| `chain.blockfrost.project-id` | with hosted Blockfrost | Required for hosted Blockfrost, ignored by yaci-store; keep in secrets, not source (env `BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID`) |
| `slot-config.*` | no | Per-network slot↔time anchor; defaults ship in `NetworkClock` |

There's no "at most one" constraint on which target each network points at —
any number of networks may point at hosted Blockfrost, a standalone
yaci-store, or a mix, independently. It's the same client either way,
selected purely by `base-url`.

### Serving several networks

`x402.networks` is a list, and everything downstream is keyed by network id — one
chain backend, scheme, settlement service and `/supported` entry per network. So
serving mainnet and preprod from one process needs no code change, only a second
list entry.

The `x402.settle` operator settings (`accept-mempool`, timeouts and rollback
watch) apply to every network, and `/supported` advertises the same allowed
`l1Confirmations` range for each. Resource servers choose the required depth per
payment through `confirmationPolicy`, so different networks can use different
requested depths.

### Loading networks from an external file

`application.yml` ships one preprod entry as a development default and imports an
optional override:

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: optional:${NETWORKS_FILE:}
```

Point `NETWORKS_FILE` at a file shaped like
[`docs/networks_example.yml`](networks_example.yml) — the natural fit for a
Kubernetes ConfigMap or a Docker secret, and it keeps project ids out of the
image:

```bash
NETWORKS_FILE=file:/etc/x402/networks.yml java -jar facilitator.jar
```

Three behaviours worth knowing before you rely on it — all verified against
Spring Boot 3.5, not assumed:

- **The list is replaced, not merged.** An external file defining `x402.networks`
  discards the entry in `application.yml` entirely. Whatever you point at must
  name *every* network you want served — including preprod, if you still want it.
- **The `file:` prefix is required.** `NETWORKS_FILE=./networks.yml` is **silently
  ignored** — you get the built-in preprod entry and no error. Use
  `file:./networks.yml`.
- **A missing file is silently ignored too**, because of the `optional:` prefix.
  That is what lets the variable be unset, but it also means a typo'd path
  degrades quietly to the preprod default instead of failing.

The last two make the failure mode "wrong networks served", not "won't start", so
confirm what actually loaded rather than assuming:

```bash
curl -s localhost:4022/supported | jq '.kinds[].network'
```

If the file is unset *and* you have removed the default entry from
`application.yml`, startup fails with `x402.networks must contain at least one
network entry` — the message names the property, not `NETWORKS_FILE`.

## Verification

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x402.verification.max-tx-bytes` | `32768` | Bound checked pre-decode (A4) and against protocol `maxTxSize` (C3) |
| `x402.verification.script-datum-policy` | `reference` | `reference` \| `strict` \| `v3-optional` |

`reference` mirrors the TS reference facilitator: no datum-kind checks, except a
`plutusV1` script whose locked output carries an inline datum is rejected (the
ledger cannot represent that combination, so the output is guaranteed
unspendable). `strict` and `v3-optional` are stricter, opt-in policies — see
[verification.md](verification.md#script--arbitrary-plutus-lock) for the full
per-policy behavior.

## Settlement

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x402.settle.confirmation-timeout` | `75s` | How long `/settle` waits (below the upstream HTTP client’s 90s timeout) |
| `x402.settle.confirmation-depth` | `1` | Deprecated; requests use confirmationPolicy (default 1) |
| `x402.settle.poll-interval` | `5s` | Inclusion poll cadence |
| `x402.settle.accept-mempool` | `false` | **Keep false** |
| `x402.settle.idempotent-replay` | `false` | Deprecated; retries always reconcile current evidence |
| `x402.settle.stability-window` | `10m` | Rollback watch window |
| `x402.settle.reconcile-horizon` | `24h` | Retained for configuration compatibility; no expiry effect. Unknown or TTL-less rows remain pending |

- **`accept-mempool`** — mempool presence is not payment. **Keep it `false`**
  regardless of chain backend. Turning it on does two things together: `/settle`
  will release a payment whose 402 asked for `l1Confirmations: -1`, and
  `/supported` drops its advertised `l1Confirmations.minimum` to `-1` so a
  resource server can quote it. Both conditions are required — an operator
  opt-in cannot weaken a stricter 402, and a 402 cannot force an operator to
  accept reversible evidence.
- **`confirmation-depth`** — retained for configuration compatibility. The wire
  policy `extra.confirmationPolicy.l1Confirmations` determines settlement depth,
  defaulting to `1` when omitted. Depth counts blocks newer than the payment's
  block: `0` means canonical inclusion. An explicit null policy is invalid.
- **`stability-window`** — controls the reconciler's rollback watch. HTTP retries
  always check current evidence, including outside this window.
- **`idempotent-replay`** — retained for configuration compatibility but no longer
  controls retries. Matching retries reconcile the existing transaction and do
  not submit again. Resource servers must persist their own operation-consumption
  state; facilitator success is evidence of payment, not permission to repeat a
  business operation.

## Duplicate cache / claim TTL

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x402.duplicate-cache.ttl` | `120s` | Also the settlement **claim TTL** |

A new-format, provably pre-broadcast `CLAIMED` row older than this may be
reclaimed by another worker. Legacy rows and any possibly broadcast row remain
observation-only. Set it above your realistic submit latency —
too low and a live worker's claim gets stolen mid-flight.

## HTTP

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x402.http.max-request-bytes` | `65536` | Over → `413` |
| `x402.http.cors-allowed-origins` | `[]` | Empty = **no cross-origin access** |

## Masumi

```yaml
x402:
  masumi:
    allowed-script-hashes:
      "cardano:mainnet":
        - "<vested_pay escrow script hash hex>"
```

Per-network escrow script-hash allowlist. **Enforcement is active only when the
list is set and non-empty.**

It is a *narrowing*, not the primary control. The facilitator already derives the
escrow address from the deployment parameters and rejects a `payTo` that does not
equal it, so a hostile address fails without any allowlist. Set this when you
want to serve only your own deployment rather than any valid `vested_pay` one.

## API exposure

The facilitator does not authenticate or rate-limit HTTP callers. The former
`x402.security.*`, `FACILITATOR_API_KEY`, and `FACILITATOR_RATE_LIMIT_RPM`
settings no longer have any effect. Compose publishes the facilitator API only
on the host's `127.0.0.1:4022`; other containers on its network can still
connect. A direct JAR launch uses Spring Boot's normal listener settings and
does not inherit that host binding. Place any remotely reachable deployment
behind an operator-managed ingress with TLS, authentication, and traffic limits.
CORS controls browser access, not caller authentication.

## Provider freshness and readiness

`x402.chain.max-tip-age` defaults to `5m` for every configured network.
The provider must report the expected genesis magic and a valid latest block
whose slot time is no older than this setting and no more than 30 seconds in
the future. A bad tip fails verification lookup, submission admission, and
inclusion checks. `/health` and `/actuator/health/readiness` report 503 when
any required network is unhealthy; optional networks are shown but do not
bring down overall readiness. Actuator liveness remains independent. Health
probes are cached for at most five seconds and tip age is rechecked on cache
hits. The wall-clock current-slot calculation remains offline.

The bundled Blockfrost-style provider has no verified watermark showing that
its transaction index has caught up to its block tip. Even when both the
transaction and mempool endpoints return 404 after the TTL, it returns
`NotSeen()` with unknown coverage. The settlement claim remains pending and
cannot be broadcast again; a previously confirmed row is not demoted by this
unknown absence. Provider 401, 429, 5xx, timeouts and stale tips also leave
the journal unchanged. Unobserved rows can occupy reconciliation capacity
indefinitely until the transaction is found or an independently verified
index-coverage source is added. Operators must investigate such rows rather
than delete their claims or manually repeat submission.

Custom `FacilitatorChainService` backends may return
`NotSeen(observedThroughSlot)` only when they can prove complete transaction
index coverage through that slot. Terminal expiry additionally requires both
the observed-through slot and current slot to exceed transaction TTL by 120
slots. A block tip alone does not satisfy this proof.

## Environment variables (Compose)

| Var | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `postgres` (local development only) | shared PostgreSQL user for the facilitator and Yaci Store |
| Facilitator API host port | `127.0.0.1:4022` | Compose publishes locally; remote ingress protection is operator-managed |
| `BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL` | hosted Blockfrost for `CARDANO_NETWORK` | facilitator — point at a standalone yaci-store's Blockfrost-compatible endpoint instead to use it |
| `BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID` | — | facilitator — required for hosted Blockfrost, ignored by yaci-store |
| `CARDANO_NETWORK` | `preprod` | All Compose profiles: node, indexer magic, Yano and canonical facilitator `X402_NETWORK_ID` |
| `CARDANO_NODE_VERSION` | `10.4.1` | node image tag |
| `X402_NETWORK_ID` | `cardano:preprod` outside Compose | Direct application network selector. Compose derives it from `CARDANO_NETWORK` |
| `MITHRIL_SYNC` | `true` | `false` skips snapshot restore |

See [../deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md).

## Minimal production example

```yaml
x402:
  networks:
    - id: "cardano:mainnet"
      chain:
        blockfrost:
          base-url: https://cardano-mainnet.blockfrost.io/api/v0
          project-id: ${BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID}
  settle:
    accept-mempool: false
  masumi:
    allowed-script-hashes:
      "cardano:mainnet": [ "${MASUMI_SCRIPT_HASH}" ]
  http:
    cors-allowed-origins: [ "https://your-resource-server.example" ]
```

Select the depth in each resource-server quote, for example
`extra: {confirmationPolicy: {l1Confirmations: 3}}`.

Work through the [mainnet readiness
checklist](../deploy/README.md#mainnet-readiness-checklist) before going live.

## Audit remediation compatibility notes

Fresh payments require a finite transaction TTL and a positive `maxTimeoutSeconds`.
Authenticated post-broadcast retries retain historical inclusion semantics.
The decoder checks auxiliary metadata commitments against the original CBOR bytes
and validates metadata bounds and text encoding. It supports legacy metadata maps
and tag-259 metadata-only envelopes. Auxiliary script bundles, Mary array envelopes
and other unsupported auxiliary formats are rejected conservatively, including when
a custom phase-1 validator is installed.

Input resolution uses one request-local session: at most 64 external UTxO calls
and ten seconds total, including cached lookups. Nonce ownership is authenticated
before resolving other inputs; address pages are reused within the request. Budget
exhaustion or lookup-worker saturation returns unknown state and verification fails
closed. These limits can reject valid payments with large input/address sets.
Eight non-queued daemon workers cap outstanding provider calls; a provider ignoring
interruption can continue after the request deadline but cannot create unlimited
workers. Inclusion and protocol-parameter I/O have separate paths and are not
covered by this input-resolution budget. Custom providers inherit a default
`openUtxoLookup()` implementation; providers making multiple external calls inside
one lookup should override it to account for every call.

Reconciliation scans at most 200 rows per sweep, ordered by `(claimed_at, tx_hash)`,
resumes after the previous batch and wraps at the end. Unchanged/unknown observations
still advance the cursor. Each instance maintains its own cursor, which resets on
restart; PostgreSQL advisory locking and fenced observations remain in effect.

Configured Blockfrost-compatible providers must expose `/genesis` with the matching
network magic (`764824073` mainnet, `1` preprod, `2` preview). Identity is checked
on health and payment chain access; mismatch or unavailable identity fails closed
and no transaction is submitted. Successful identity checks are cached for 30 seconds.
Application construction and wall-clock slot calculation remain offline; a provider
that is still starting makes health/payment checks fail until its identity is available.
