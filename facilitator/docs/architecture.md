# Architecture

A single Spring Boot service. Two things make the shape non-obvious and are worth
reading before changing anything: the **chain backend is one Blockfrost client
whose target is configurable** (hosted Blockfrost, or a standalone yaci-store
instance consumed over its Blockfrost-compatible API, chosen per network via
`base-url`), and **settlement is a journalled state machine**, not a
request-scoped operation.

## Package layout

```

`model` / `service` / `controller` carry the required layering; `chain`,
`repository`, and `config` are additional packages for the SPI, persistence, and
wiring.

## Request flow

```
POST /verify or /settle
  → CorrelationIdFilter      HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE      X-Correlation-Id (generated if absent)
  → RequestSizeFilter        (unordered ⇒ last)      byte cap → 413
  → FacilitatorController    null checks; registry lookup
  → X402FacilitatorRegistry  (2, "exact", normalize(network)) → handler
  → DefaultSchemeNetworkFacilitator
      ├── verify → ExactCardanoScheme      stages A–E
      └── settle → SettlementGate → SettlementService
```

Correlation runs first so every rejection downstream is traceable.
`RequestSizeFilter` enforces the byte cap before controller parsing. The
facilitator has no application-level API authentication or rate limiter;
Compose publishes its API on host loopback.

The registry keys on `(scheme, normalized network)` and rejects any
`x402Version != 2` outright. An unregistered triple returns HTTP 500
(see [api.md](api.md)).

`DefaultSchemeNetworkFacilitator` delegates through injected `BiFunction`s rather
than depending on the verification and settlement services directly. That keeps
the dependency graph acyclic — settlement itself needs the verifier, which would
otherwise form a cycle.

## Chain access layer

Everything chain-facing sits behind an SPI, so verification and settlement never
know which backend they're on:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FacilitatorChainService` | UTxO state, current slot, submit, inclusion, health |
| `ProtocolParamsProvider` | min-UTxO coefficient, max tx size, minimum fee coefficient and constant |
| `NetworkClock` | slot ↔ POSIX time (Masumi deadlines) |

### `UtxoState` is tri-state

`Unspent` | `Spent` | `Unknown`. The third is load-bearing: an indexer behind the
tip cannot tell "never existed" from "not yet indexed". Both collapses are real
bugs — into `Spent` rejects honest payments, into `Unspent` accepts replays. So
`Unknown` degrades to a retryable `chain_lookup_failed`. Same rule for
`SubmissionResult.Unknown`: a submission that *might* have been broadcast never
releases the claim.

`Unspent` carries the owner plus lovelace and native-asset quantities. Fresh
verification requires these quantities to check conservation. `Spent` retains the
historical owner where available, so a proven broadcast can be authenticated
without pretending its consumed input is still unspent. New-format journal rows
also retain the payer established before submission.

### `InclusionResult` is the evidence ladder

`NotSeen` | `Mempool` | `Included(depth, …)`, matching the spec's
`l1Confirmations` levels of `-1`, `0` and `n`. **`depth` counts blocks *newer*
than the containing block**, so a transaction in the tip has depth `0` —
"canonical inclusion" — not `1`. `Mempool` comes from Blockfrost's
`/mempool/{hash}`, which the backend interface does not expose, so it goes over
raw HTTP; a provider fault answers "not pending" rather than throwing, since
mempool presence only ever strengthens evidence.

### The chain backend

There is exactly one backend: the cardano-client-lib Blockfrost provider
(`BFBackendService`, wrapped in `BlockfrostChainService`). `ChainBackendFactory`
builds it from a single property per network, `chain.blockfrost.base-url` (env
`BLOCKFROST_BASE_URL`), plus `chain.blockfrost.project-id` (env
`BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID`). There is no "chain mode" concept — no Spring profile,
no alternate code path.

Because yaci-store exposes a Blockfrost-compatible API, the same client serves
a standalone yaci-store just as well as hosted Blockfrost — `base-url` just
points at a different host:

| | Hosted Blockfrost | Standalone yaci-store |
|---|---|---|
| `base-url` | Blockfrost's hosted API (default) | e.g. `http://yaci-store:8080/api/v1/blockfrost` |
| `project-id` | required | ignored |
| Infra | none beyond a project id | a `yaci-store` deployment (its own cardano-node sync + Postgres) |
| Submission | Blockfrost `tx/submit` | yaci-store's `/tx/submit`, forwarded to its node |

The facilitator does not embed an indexer, a JPA store, or any yaci-store
library code; when yaci-store is used it runs as its own service (see
[../deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md)) and is addressed over HTTP,
identically to Blockfrost.

Because both targets share `BlockfrostChainService`, both inherit its
`404 → Spent` semantics (see "`UtxoState` is tri-state" above). Neither
resolution produces `UtxoState.Unknown` today — it remains part of the SPI
contract for a future backend that can distinguish "not yet indexed" from
"never existed", but nothing currently returns it. `SubmissionResult.Unknown`
is unaffected: a transport failure after the wire still returns it either way,
since the node may have accepted the submission regardless.

---

## Settlement

Settlement can't be request-scoped: a tx may land after the HTTP response, the
process may die mid-submit, and a confirmed block may roll back. So state is
journalled in Postgres and swept asynchronously.

### State and claims

A fresh payment is verified, then atomically claims its transaction hash and,
for Masumi, seller-signed terms digest in the same database row. `SUBMITTING` is
persisted before any wire I/O. Every ownership transition is fenced by attempt
ID and expected status.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CLAIMED` | Reserved; a new-format local row proves no submission yet |
| `SUBMITTING` | May have reached the provider; uncertainty retains the claim |
| `SUBMITTED` | Locally submitted and accepted, or observed after rollback |
| `NOT_CONFIRMED` | Confirmation threshold not yet reached |
| `CONFIRMED` | Evidence reached the persisted per-request threshold |
| `FAILED` | Definitive rejection tombstone for new-format rows |
| `EXPIRED` | NotSeen beyond transaction TTL plus 120-slot grace; never eligible for rebroadcast |

A proven `NotSubmitted` outcome releases both claims atomically. A definitive
rejection retains both. Timeout, transport uncertainty, process death after
`SUBMITTING`, expiry, and rollback never release a possibly broadcast claim.
Only a stale new-format local `CLAIMED` row can be reclaimed.

### Retry and confirmation policy

The normalized requirements and resource URL bind the transaction to one payment.
Every matching retry authenticates the payload and method again, while skipping
pre-broadcast-only checks when durable provenance or independent canonical
evidence permits it. It checks current evidence even for a previously confirmed
payment; it never returns a cached success merely because an old request passed.

`confirmationPolicy.l1Confirmations` selects `-1..20`, defaulting to `1`.
Confirmation depth is persisted, so the reconciler cannot promote a payment using
a weaker process default. Observed confirmations are returned to callers.
Unresolved outcomes return `settlement_pending` with the original hash, allowing
upstream core's one automatic retry. The resource server separately owns
business-operation consumption and its own durable Masumi quote store.

### Existing V1 rows

V2 adds policy, provenance, acceptance and terms-digest columns without changing
V1. Historical rows have unknown policy, `LEGACY` provenance and no assumed
acceptance: old `SUBMITTED` records may have originated in the removed client
mode. The reconciler cannot invent missing policy. A matching, fully validated
retry can bind it, but only current canonical evidence can establish success.
Legacy `FAILED` and `EXPIRED` rows are not automatically reclaimed. No V1 status
or response JSON grants permission to rebroadcast or return cached success.

### Reconciler

`@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 30s, initialDelay = 30s)` sweeps up to 200 rows that are
`SUBMITTING`/`SUBMITTED`/`NOT_CONFIRMED`, plus `CONFIRMED` rows still inside the
stability window (rollback watch).

On Postgres it takes a `pg_try_advisory_lock`, so **only one instance sweeps** —
horizontal scaling is safe. On other vendors (H2 in tests) it runs unlocked.

A `ChainLookupException` **skips** the row and preserves its state. Errors are
never treated as absence — that's what would turn a Blockfrost blip into a
wrongly-`EXPIRED` payment.

### Settlement gate

Fresh `POST /settle` calls return **503** when the network backend is unhealthy.
A retry with an existing transaction row bypasses only this health precheck and
reaches journal reconciliation, which can return protocol pending without a new
submission. The stored binding and full retry authentication still apply.

---

## Persistence

One table, `facilitator.settlement`, keyed by `tx_hash`:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tx_hash` | `varchar(64)` | **PK** — the idempotency arbiter |
| `attempt_id` | `uuid` | NOT NULL — the CAS fence |
| `requirements_digest` | `varchar(64)` | NOT NULL — SHA-256 |
| `network`, `status` | `varchar(64)`, `varchar(16)` | NOT NULL |
| `payer`, `pay_to`, `asset`, `amount` | | nullable |
| `transfer_method`, `nonce_outref`, `tx_ttl_slot` | | nullable |
| `claimed_at` | `timestamptz` | NOT NULL |
| `submitted_at`, `confirmed_at`, `confirmed_slot`, `confirmed_block` | | nullable |
| `error_reason`, `response_json` | | nullable |
| `selected_confirmations` | `integer` | nullable only for historical policy; -1..20 |
| `submission_provenance` | `varchar(16)` | `LEGACY` or `LOCAL` |
| `submission_accepted` | `boolean` | authenticated local provider acceptance |
| `terms_digest` | `varchar(64)` | unique when present; atomic Masumi quote claim |

Index `idx_settlement_status_claimed (status, claimed_at)` serves the reconciler
sweep and staleness queries.

Migrations run programmatically (`spring.flyway.enabled: false`):
`FlywayConfig.facilitatorFlyway` applies `classpath:db/migration` into the
`facilitator` schema with its own history table. That's the only Flyway runner
in the facilitator process — yaci-store, when used, runs as a separate service
and migrates its own schema independently, so the two never share a history
table or interfere.

## Startup validation

Fails fast rather than surfacing misconfiguration as runtime errors:

- `x402.networks` non-empty
- every network id supported (`cardano:mainnet|preprod|preview`, CIP-34 aliases ok)
- every network declares `chain.blockfrost.base-url`

## Cross-cutting

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Logging | Log4j2 (`log4j2-spring.xml`), JSON layout available; `%X{correlationId}` |
| Metrics | Micrometer → `/actuator/prometheus` |
| Correlation | `X-Correlation-Id` generated/echoed/logged; `500` bodies carry it and nothing else |
| Concurrency | Virtual threads (`spring.threads.virtual.enabled: true`) |
| JSON bounds | `StreamReadConstraints` under the byte cap (defence in depth) |

### Reconciliation fairness

Sweeps use a bounded 200-row keyset page ordered by claim time and transaction hash.
The per-instance cursor advances even when observations fail or remain uncertain,
then wraps after the last eligible row. A restart resets the cursor; an advisory-lock
miss does not. Unknown or TTL-less records are preserved rather than expired to free
queue capacity. No database migration is required for this scheduling change.
